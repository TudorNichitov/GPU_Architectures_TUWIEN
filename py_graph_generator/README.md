### Fenz, Fuchssteiner, Nichitov, Spitzer

## Dependencies and Requirements
Our Graph Generator is implemented in Python (3.9) leveraging the library NetworkX (2.8.1).
We used conda (4.8.2) as a package manager. See the conda environment.yml for further details of packages used in this repository.

## Install
### Conda
We use Conda as package manager and provide an environment.yml defining the conda environment used in the evaluations.
For details go to: [install conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)

## Install Python & Dependencies
Create a conda environment and install all python dependencies using the provided environment.yml file:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
The created environment is named 'gpu_env', activate with:
```bash
conda activate gpu_env
```

## Usage
```bash
cd ./py_graph_generator

main.py [-h] [-n N] [-t TYPE] [-s SEED] [-d DIR] [-p PROB] [-a ALPHA] [-b BETA] [-g GAMMA] [-din DELTA_IN] [-dout DELTA_OUT] [-e DENSITY]

optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -n N, --n N           Number of nodes
    -t TYPE, --type TYPE  Graph type; choose from ['erdos', 'scale', 'path', 'ring', 'complete', 'tree', 'empty', 'custom']
    -s SEED, --seed SEED  Indicator of random number generation state.
    -d DIR, --dir DIR     Directory to write graph files

    -p PROB, --prob PROB  [for Erdos-Renyi graphs only]: edge probability

    -a ALPHA, --alpha ALPHA [for Scale-free graphs only]: Probability for adding an edge from an new node to an existing node
    -b BETA, --beta BETA  [for Scale-free graphs only]: Probability for adding an edge between two existing nodes.
    -g GAMMA, --gamma GAMMA [for Scale-free graphs only]: Probability for adding an edge from an existing node to new node
    -din DELTA_IN, --delta_in DELTA_IN [for Scale-free graphs only]: Bias for choosing nodes from in-degree distribution.
    -dout DELTA_OUT, --delta_out DELTA_OUT [for Scale-free graphs only]: Bias for choosing nodes from out-degree distribution.
    
    -e DENSITY, --density DENSITY [for Custom graphs only]: Targeted density of the graph.
```

## Reproducibility
To create a huge variety of graphs, we provide additionally some bash scripts. The graphs generated by using these bash
scripts are shown in the evaluations in our report.
The input data as bases for our computational results shown in the report was generated with:

```bash
  bash generate_rnd_n_100-1k_samples10.sh
```

```bash
  bash generate_rnd_n_1k-10k_samples5.sh
```

### Output

The generated graphs are stored in a custom file format located, *unless defined otherwise*, in **[data/](data)** after
running the main.py script.
*Note: For convenience, we already included a large body of sample graphs, which we used in our evaluations.*
